            <h2>Squat</h2>
            <p>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.</p>
            <h2>Bench</h2>
            <p>The bench press or chest press is a weight training exercise where a person presses a weight upwards while lying horizontally on a weight training bench. The bench press is a compound movement, with the primary muscles involved being the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps brachii. Other muscles located in the back, legs and core are involved for stabilization. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.</p>
            <h2>Deadlift</h2>
            <p>The deadlift is a strength training exercise in which a weight-loaded barbell is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, with the torso perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting movements along with the squat and bench press,[1] as well as a quintessential lift in strongman. The all-time world record deadlift stands at 510 kg (1,124 lb), achieved by Iceland's Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson.</p>
